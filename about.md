I am a graduate in Computer and Software Systems Engineering from Queensland. I recently moved to Melbourne and started my grad program with MYOB. My interests include reading books in general, but I enjoy reading murder mysteries the most. I love listening to songsðŸŽ¶ from all over the world (even though I don't understand the meaning, the music is what appeals to me). Among all the things I love, programming tops it all!ðŸ˜ƒ
