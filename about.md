This is my "WELCOME TO MY BLOG. YOU'RE IN FOR A RIDE" FACE.

I am a graduate in Computer and Software Systems Engineering from Queensland. I recently moved to Melbourne and started my grad program with MYOB. My interests include reading books in general, but I enjoy reading murder mysteries the most. I love listening to songs 🎶 from all over the world (even though I don't understand the meaning, the music is what appeals to me). Among all the things I love - including tea, animals that eat and sleep a lot like pandas 🐼 (evident from my avatar) and koalas 🐨 , programming tops it all!😃 

### More information

Now, let's get to some embarassing facts about me. I have butter fingers and am a messy eater. My motto is "Live life to the fullest; except when you're short on money and something needs a lot of it". I love stationeries (pens, pencil - I literally have a mount load of them) and even if one pen goes missing, I end up crying till I find it.
