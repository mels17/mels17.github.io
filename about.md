This is my "WELCOME TO MY BLOG. YOU'RE IN FOR A RIDE" FACE.

I am a graduate in Computer and Software Systems Engineering from Queensland. I recently moved to Melbourne and started my grad program with MYOB. My interests include reading books in general, but I enjoy reading murder mysteries the most. I love listening to songs 🎶 from all over the world (even though I don't understand the meaning, the music is what appeals to me). Among all the things I love - including tea, animals that eat and sleep a lot like pandas 🐼 (evident from my avatar) and koalas 🐨 , programming tops it all!😃 Note: If you go to MYOB and ask to see Malavika, I'm sure someone will say that no one by that name works in this office. So you may want to remember me as Mel.

### More information

A question everyone asks me: When did I decide to become a programmer? Well, I can say not until 4 years ago, when I was making a career choice. Until then it was all sort of things: ranging from a doctor to a lawyer, a food blogger to a food critic (just so I could eat food and it's still on my retirement list of things to do). Since I had no idea until near the end of my high school, I just thought what would I enjoy. Something that had a certain thrill to it, involved mathematics and something was constantly changing and that lead me to programming. On that note, not everyone is ready to take up a job that matches with their passion - mostly because it does not pay well. I was lucky that my career choice aligned with my passion.

Now, let's get to some embarassing facts about me. I have butter fingers and am a messy eater. My motto is "Live life to the fullest; except when you're short on money and something needs a lot of it". I love stationeries (pens, pencil - I literally have a mount load of them) and even if one pen goes missing, I end up crying till I find it. Things I don't like but not limited to - fitness and healthy eating. Things I like - lazing around and eating whatever I want whenever I want!
