title: Before MYOB

I'm originally from India but was born and brought-up in Oman. I moved to Australia for my higher studies. I graduated from Queensland University of Technology(QUT) with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. During this time, I was exposed to different programming languages like Java, C, C#, C++, Python and MATLAB and among them I enjoyed programming in Java and Python the most. My final year uni project was with the Human-Computer Interaction department. The project involved creating an interface to make it easier for people to learn bird songs and explore nature. Through this project, I got a hands-on approach to software design and development. I did some tutoring in-between to enhance my knowledge.
