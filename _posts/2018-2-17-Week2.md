title: Week 2(Spoiler: contains a story)
---

Things became more and more interesting this week cause it was all about programming. This week was full of new things - meeting with my mentor, stand-ups, learning Kotlin and Test-driven-development. The week began with me wanting to learn a new programming language - Kotlin. I met with my mentor after the stand-up and discussed where to start. He suggested I start with the Payroll coding challenge using Kotlin. So, I started learning Kotlin along with working out the logic for the challenge. On the first day, I was searching for Kotlin libraries that could help me solve the challenge. I realized after sometime that most of the libraries were Java-based. At the end of the day, after nearly 8 hours of unyielding search, I made an incredible discovery, that Kotlin was based on Java and that we are actually meant to use Java libraries. I learned many things about Kotlin, I belived Kotlin was purely functional but I came to know that it is actually flexible and can be object-oriented as well. Kotlin is replacing Javascript in many Andriod applications and big organizations like Google have come to recognize the pros of using Kotlin as it gives clean-code (no side-effects and immutable).

I started writing the code logic in my book (I can't do without a book and pen). Then I started programming. I usually always write a messy code and then refactor it and that's how I was planning to do here as well. After writing the messy code that works, my mentor asked me to write test cases for it. At first, I didn't think much of it but as I started writing the tests I realized the importance of it. I found errors in places I never thought I would. After completing the test cases, my mentor asked me to keep the code as is so I can check my progress after. The feeling of seeing the test cases pass is a sense of fulfillment and happiness and of seeing the test fail is a sense of excitement and depression (in extreme cases!) 

I thought I should write this here! This is one of the things I wrote in my book.

Apologies to all horror movie lovers and writers!!

### Programming Horror Stories - Chapter 1

Starring: Microsoft Excel, Java and Kotlin

Disclaimer: The story is based on programming facts and the writer's state of mind. Anyone who has a logical reasoning for this, please do tell! But until then, I will most certainly blame it on the Ghost of Programming.

It all started on a Tuesday afternoon. Mel was working on a coding challenge at her desk in the office while sipping tea. Everything was going well, until... there came a point where she should parse a String to an Int. The string was taken from an Excel .csv file. The string from the very first cell of the .csv file contained a mysterious character. She tried everything ranging from manually getting rid of leading/training spaces in Excel to trimming spaces/tabs in Java. But nothing worked. The mysterious character still remained - unscathed. Mel stared intensely at her screen, fixing her eye on the number "2" - the length of the string in the first cell where there was only one character. The horror clearly visible on her face with Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho tune playing in her head. 

Update: Solution is to save the excel as a normal .csv file rather than a delimited .csv file.
