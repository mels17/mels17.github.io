Things became more and more interesting this week cause it was all about programming. This week was full of new things - meeting with my mentor, stand-ups, learning Kotlin and Test-driven-development. The week started of with me wanting to learn a new programming language - Kotlin. I met with my mentor after the stand-up and discussed where to start. He suggested I start with the Payroll coding challenge using Kotlin. So, I started learning Kotlin along with working out the logic for the challenge.
