title: Hack Day 
---

My first hack-a-thon... I have got to write a blog post on it. The hack-days were on the 17th and 18th May 2018. I went into the office, early as usual, started on my usual work and then thought for sometime on how the day was going to turn out, cause I had no idea what I wanted to do. I wanted to collaborate with different people, get to know MYOB software more and program to my heart's content without having to think how the finished product looked like or whether I could finish the product in just two days. And I realized that was the whole purpose of hack days, to make people think, discover problems, make a start to solving those problems, all the while, enjoying with no stress. And that was also the theme of this hack-day, work on problems you encounter on a daily-basis. However, it should be related to MYOB. 

But this constraint, narrowed what I could do on those two days. You see, I had no experience working with MYOB software and I haven't been there long enough to notice problems, which meant, joining someone who had an idea. And if I can't find something that is of interest to me, then I would self-study, do some work on my own, which I was not keen to. For me, that somehow defeated the purpose of hack-days.

So, I decided to walk all over the office to know what people are doing. I didn't have to walk much further, when I found something interesting. This team was aiming to make the life of MYOB employees easier. According to them, for a software company, a process for employees to register the times they were on on-call manually, was not ideal. They wanted to automate that process.
