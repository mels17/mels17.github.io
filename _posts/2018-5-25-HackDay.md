title: Hack Day 
---

This story does not start from the first day at MYOB office, but the day before. I was so excited for this job as this is also my first one. That night I couldn't even sleep, all I could think was how this new phase of my life would be. I had a vague memory of the time we were supposed to report at the office (I tried finding the email, but it mysteriously disappeared from my mailbox). Assuming reporting time is 9:00am, I left from my home at 8 and reached MYOB 20 mins later. Little did I know my mind was playing tricks on me (again!, this was not the first time). The reporting time was 9:30. Typical me.

First and foremost, I have got to say this -  We got a new 15" MacBook Pro - What? Now, that's what I call a great workplace. Also, I was smiling from one ear to the other.Hmmm.. what else. I'm clouded by the image of a new laptop in my head that I can't think. Oh yeah, right! This week was exciting and an out-of-the-world experience for me, since this was my first actual job. Learned so many things in so little time. Did so many things I never would have ever done - dancing (kinda - I was just standing and moving my head in a really awkward way), singing (couldn't muster up courage for this) and even making swans (I was an arts major ðŸ˜‚ - What? Art was like my sworn enemy in high school. My friends helped me fill up my drawing book before every evaluation. My Art teacher knew that, but didn't say anything because he saw my drawing once - Yeah, that bad!!). There was one day, we all spend in the Glen Waverly office to familiarize ourselves with what MYOB offers. Highlight of that day was spending 1-2hrs with the support services. I got to spend that time with Ali, one of the customer support staff. I realized then that the job required a lot of knowledge of MYOB products and a lot and I mean literally a lot of patience. Wow, I can't imagine myself doing anything else other than programming and that made me realise that programming and I were destined to be.  

Last but not in anyway the least, I got to meet a lot of awesome people, one of whom became my mentor, Andrew King. At the end of the week, I arranged to meet-up with my mentor the following week.

But I do have to say, after 6 months of lazing around in the sofa: reading books and watching Netflix, the first week left me a bit tired, but still happy!!
