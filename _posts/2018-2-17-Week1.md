This story does not start from the first day at MYOB office, but the day before. I was so excited for this job as this is also my first one. That night I couldn't even sleep, all I could think was how this new phase of my life would be. I had a vague memory of the time we were supposed to report at the office (I tried finding the email, but it mysteriously disappeared from my mailbox). Assuming reporting time is 9:00am, I left from my home at 8 and reached MYOB 20 mins later. Little did I know my mind was playing tricks on me (again!, this was not the first time). The reporting time was 9:30. Typical me.

What can I say. This week was exciting and an out-of-the-world experience for me, since this was my first actual job. Learned so many things in so little time. Did so many things I never would have ever done - dancing (kinda - I was just standing and moving my head in a really awkward way), singing (couldn't muster up courage for this) and even making swans (I was an arts major 😂 - What? Art was like my sworn enemy in high school. My friends helped me fill up my drawing book before every evaluation. My Art teacher knew that, but didn't say anything because he saw my drawing once - Yeah, that bad!!). But I do have to say, after 6 months of lazing around in the sofa: reading books and watching Netflix, the first week left me a bit tired, but still happy!!

I got to meet a lot of awesome people, one of whom became my mentor.
