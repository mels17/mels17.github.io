title: HTTP Server and Hello World Deployment
---

The focus of Hello World was to learn about Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, not about the actual implementation. It was about building a simple RESTful API to display messages according to the client requests. There was a lot of Amazon documentation I had to get my head around and CI/CD was new to me. So, this is the flow from what I understand, ```Make changes to code -> push to github -> Travis pulls the code -> runs tests on it -> uploads the solution to S3 bucket -> Code Deploy tranfers the code to the Amazon EC2 instance to the Tomcat webapps folder```. Tomcat then runs the application on the specified port.

When implementing this, I did not use build frameworks like Gradle or Maven, because it never crossed my mind. However, for the application to be build by Travis it needed a build file. So, I did a quick-fix, I auto-generated a Ant build file, a feature that IntelliJ offers. Also, MYOB uses Buildkite instead of Travis, but at the time I was doing this, I did not have the permission to use Buildkite, so I had to do with using Travis. But others who have used Buildkite, says it's much easier to use than Travis. I understood CI/CD is really useful, if you have tests on the pipeline, when you change a piece of your code, you just need to push the code to Github and the pipeline will do the rest.

HTTP server marks the end of the roadmap of the acceleration stage. You need to create a http server from scratch in Java using sockets, without using any outside frameworks. Truth be told, I didn't know how servers work. I always took advantage of the HTTP libraries and starting up a server was just a couple of lines and done!

I started implementing a multi-threaded server using sockets and a threadpool allowing upto 10 client threads at a time and a simple get request handler. Then I setup my server to be tested against the cob-spec tests; these are a list of tests that a basic http server should pass. So, implementing this server involved a TDD approach; red, green and refactor. But, I wanted to go out of the way and not refactor until the very end, so I could see how patterns develop. 

The hardest of the cob-spec tests, were getting the partial content - displaying a part of the file, and image content - sending an image as the response. Tried a lot of different ways until I cracked it! The cob-spec tests introduced concepts that I was not aware of before, but sometimes it was not clearly documented what was the expectation.

After all the tests passed, I had this very large file with nearly 700+ lines of code and a very large if-else loop (solution: command-pattern). I understood the way patterns worked and you use it when you see your code needs it, and that requires experience. For routing, I started with a hash-map with regex keys, refactored it to using two hash-maps with string keys with general requests like "GET" and the second hash-map for path like "/tea". The final version has the router as a list, where I have a custom Request Matcher as the key and the matches method that compares the request method and the path. I felt this project helped me understand the different headers used in HTTP servers, what the effects of not refactoring regularly are and when does patterns come into play.
