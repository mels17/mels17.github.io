This story does not start from the first day at MYOB office, but the day before. I was so excited for this job as this is also my first one. That night I couldn't even sleep, all I could think was how this new phase of my life would be. I had a vague memory of the time we were supposed to report at the office (I tried finding the email, but it mysteriously disappeared from my mailbox). Assuming reporting time is 9:00am, I left from my home at 8 and reached MYOB 20 mins later. Little did I know my mind was playing tricks on me (again!, this was not the first time). The reporting time was 9:30. Typical me.
